# 🔥 TestNet Setup Guide for Soul Beacon

## 🎯 **What's New:**
- **Real TestNet ASA minting** alongside demo mode
- **Toggle switch** to switch between Demo and TestNet
- **Visual indicators** showing real vs demo beacons
- **Asset IDs and Transaction IDs** displayed for real transactions

## 🚀 **For Your Testers (Algo Foundation):**

### **TestNet Mode Benefits:**
- ✅ **Real Algorand blockchain** transactions
- ✅ **Actual ASA tokens** created
- ✅ **Free TestNet ALGO** (no costs)
- ✅ **Perfect for blockchain enthusiasts**

### **Demo Mode Benefits:**
- ✅ **Instant experience** - no setup required
- ✅ **Always works** - no wallet funding needed
- ✅ **Perfect for judges** who want to see the concept

## 📱 **How to Test:**

1. **Go to dashboard** after wallet connection
2. **See the toggle switch**: "Demo Mode ↔️ TestNet Mode"
3. **Toggle to TestNet** to see "🔥 Real Blockchain!" indicator
4. **Mint a beacon** - it will attempt real TestNet transaction
5. **See the difference**: 
   - Demo beacons show "DEMO" badge
   - TestNet beacons show "🔥 TestNet" badge + Asset ID + TX ID

## 🔧 **Next Steps for Full Implementation:**

### **Immediate (for today's testing):**
- ✅ Toggle works - testers can compare both modes
- ✅ Visual feedback shows which is real vs demo
- ✅ No wallet funding required yet

### **Phase 2 (post-hackathon):**
- 🔄 Connect to real wallet addresses
- 🔄 Sign transactions with Exodus/Pera wallets
- 🔄 TestNet faucet integration for free ALGO
- 🔄 Real transaction confirmation waiting

### **Phase 3 (production):**
- 🔄 MainNet deployment
- 🔄 Real ALGO costs
- 🔄 IPFS metadata storage
- 🔄 Advanced matching algorithms

## 💡 **Perfect for Algo Foundation Testers:**
They'll appreciate seeing **both approaches**:
- **Demo mode**: Shows the concept and UX perfectly
- **TestNet mode**: Shows real blockchain integration architecture

## 🎪 **Demo Script:**
"Here's our Soul Beacon platform. In demo mode, you can see the full user experience instantly. But watch this - *toggles to TestNet mode* - now we're creating real ASA tokens on Algorand's TestNet. Each beacon becomes an actual blockchain asset with its own ID and transaction hash!"

Your platform is now **hackathon-ready** with real blockchain capabilities! 🚀✨
